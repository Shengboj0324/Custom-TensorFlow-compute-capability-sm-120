    SM120MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=8, key_dim=64),
    SM120Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)  # Full training pipeline
```

### **Declarative Model Building**
```python
# Transformer with SM120 optimization
transformer = create_sm120_transformer_encoder(
    vocab_size=30000,
    max_length=1024,
